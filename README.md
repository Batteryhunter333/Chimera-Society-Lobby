# Welcome to the Chimera Society Lobby repo!
This is the public repository for the lobby of my roblox game [Chimera Society](https://www.roblox.com/games/106820629618215/Chimera-Society).
**You can find the repo for the actual game's code [here](https://github.com/Batteryhunter333/Chimera-Society-Source)!**

## ABOUT:

This repo contains all the scripts used in my Rojo project connected to the lobby's studio place, as well as anything else I might need for development purposes. 
This repo is actively used for the development of the game, so if you find that kinda stuff interesting feel free to poke around!

> <sub>*Though, the game isn't out, so I have no idea why you'd be here right now...*</sub>

**Feel free to use this project as a reference for your own games!**
I want this to be a useful resource for any developers who might find value in any of this.
The code isn't perfect, but I'd like to imagine someone could find some of this to be helpful :)
